# Hidden Call Recorder - Privacy Policy
This document clariﬁes how User data and any sensitive information is handled in the App.

### Recording Call - Microphone

We do not hold any recordings or User information on our own servers.
The App “Hidden Call Recorder” records phone calls. All recorded calls are recorded on the phone using the microphone on the device. The recorded ﬁles and related notes are stored on the phone’s storage and NO server is involved with recording phone calls. The recorded calls are not stored on our own server.

### Storage
The App requests permission to access the phone’s storage only in order to store the recorded calls and play the recorded ﬁles afterwards. The App does not access any other ﬁles nor excess User’s photos.

### Contacts
The App accesses the contacts on the phone in order to display the contacts that were recorded and so the App can record or ignore calls from speciﬁc contacts. The contacts information is NOT transmitted nor stored on any server.

## Third-party collected Data
The App uses several third parties in order to improve our services. These parties collect their own data. Please read their privacy policies (see the links below) to ensure that you’re comfortable with the manner in which they collect data.

### Ads
Google Admob: The free version of our android Application includes some ads displayed with Google Admob. Please check the policy at: https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/ 

### Google drive
#### NOTICE: this feature is under development. Currently Hidden Call Recorder does not upload ANY recordings or anything else to Google drive or anywhere else.
A User that desires to backup recorded calls can do so by synchronising these recorded calls to Google Drive. In that case the user will authorise the app to access the User's Google Drive and the app will sync saved recorded calls to Google Drive storage on the User's own storage folders on their own Google Drive account. To be clear that the App does not store the recorded calls on any server other than the Google Drive and no one else but the user or any app the user authorised will have access to these files. The user account and authorisation information will only be stored locally and internally by the app and will not be transmitted or stored anywhere else.   

Please check Google please see if you want to synchronise your file to Google Drive.
